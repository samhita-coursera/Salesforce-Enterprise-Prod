Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

<p>We’re hearing that it’s a race to keep up with changing technology. 70% of CEOs say their organization doesn’t have the skills to adapt to changes driven by digital technologies. Software engineers have to redevelop their skills <a href="https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/learning-in-the-digital-age.html">every 12-18 months</a>.</p>

</p>As a knowledge professional, I am sure you must have already recognized the need to incorporate MOOCs and online learning in your organization's training strategy.</p>

<p>Coursera for Business provides curated online courses that map to the skills your organization needs. We have courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/emerging-technologies">Emerging Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented">Object Oriented Java Programming</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>
