    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Trust you are well!


As you know, organizations today are facing the twin challenge of a changing business environment as well as the changing nature of workforce.

70% of CEOs say their organization does not have the skills to adapt to changes driven by digital technologies. On the other hand, 65% of millennial graduates said that the opportunity for personal development was the most influential factor in choosing a job.


As a knowledge professional, I am sure you must have already recognized the need to build a continuous learning culture and the need to incorporate MOOCs and online learning in your organization&apos;s training strategy.

Coursera for Business provides curated online courses that map to the skills your organization needs. We have over 1700 courses covering both new and emerging areas such as Digital Transformation, Data Science and Internet of Things as well as traditional areas such as Leadership Development (for both senior leaders and future leaders), Behavioral Skills as well as Functional Business Skills.

I&apos;d love to connect with you to see if Coursera for Business might be a fit. Would you or someone from your team have time for a quick chat sometime this week?


Best regards,

Kunal
