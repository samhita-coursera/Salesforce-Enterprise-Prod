    <subject>Keep Pace with Changing Tech Skills</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

We’re hearing that it’s a race to keep up with changing technology. 70% of CEOs say their organization doesn’t have the skills to adapt to changes driven by digital technologies. Software engineers have to redevelop their skills every 12-18 months ( see: https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/learning-in-the-digital-age.html ).

Coursera for Business has courses like Duke University’s Java Programming ( see: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming ) and UCSD’s Object Oriented Java Programming ( see: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented ).

Who is the right person on your team to speak with to see if Coursera for Business might be a fit?</textOnly>
