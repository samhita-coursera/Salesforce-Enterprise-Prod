    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for attending the webinar “A Corporate Learning Revolution” hosted by SHRM in partnership with Coursera.


Here’s a link to the recording in case you missed out or wish to revisit some parts of the talk.


I would love to understand how {!Lead.Company} is using eLearning and MOOCs in its overall learning and development strategy. Are you actively looking at moving from an In-classroom training to eLearning? Or looking to supplement your existing learning programs with eLearning and mobile learning?


Would you or someone from your team have time for a quick call next week?


Best regards,
Aditya Shailaj
