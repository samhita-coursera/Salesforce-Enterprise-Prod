Hi David, 

As the Director of L&D {insert role], I wanted to share a trend I noticed with your employees. 

As of today, over XX employees have enrolled in a Coursera online course (based on users who created an account with their @XXX.com email) - mainly to upskill in data science, programming or digital transformation.  

It'd be great to share how we have leveraged employees' interest from other XXX organisations we have partnered with recently (BNY Mellon, BlackRock etc.).  

How can we connect so I can share more?
