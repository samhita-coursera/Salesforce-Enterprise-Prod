Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

I am following up on an email I sent you a few days ago regarding Coursera for Business. 

It would be great to discuss how we can partner together to provide the successful training you desire. Please let me know if you have time for a 20 minute call in the coming days.

I am looking forward to exploring the possibility of Coursera and {!Account.Name} working together.

Best regards, 
Adam
