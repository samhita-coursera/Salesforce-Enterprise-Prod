Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for reaching out to Coursera! My name is Heliatrice and I am an enterprise solutions representative at Coursera. To better address your demand, I would like to confirm the number of employees you are planning to offer courses for. 

In the form, you pointed out around XX learners, is it the case? If you think there is room for 200 employees or more, I would like to present a very complete offer called Coursera for Business. Otherwise, if you indeed have a smaller let me know and I will connect you with my colleague in charge of offer for deployments under 200 people.

Thank you very much in advance for the clarification and looking forward to hearing from you.
Best,
Heliatrice
