Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I am following up with you on the email I sent you some days ago about Coursera for Business. I would like to know if you are still interested in getting information about our offer and how it can respond to your learning needs. If you are interested, I would love to give you a call to hear from you how we can potentially collaborate. 

I am looking forward to hearing from you and continue exploring the possibility of partnership if you think Coursera for Business fits the learning needs of {!Account.Name}. 

Best regards, 
Heliatrice
