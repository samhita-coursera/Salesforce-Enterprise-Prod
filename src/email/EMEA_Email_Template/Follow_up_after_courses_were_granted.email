Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up with you on the Coursera course you were granted to - how is it going? Do you like the course? 

I would love to hear from you about your experience with Coursera and to know whether you would like to continue exploring the possibilities of a partnership between {!Account.Name} and Coursera. 

Best regards,
Heliatrice
