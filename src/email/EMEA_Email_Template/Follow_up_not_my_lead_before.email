Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Heliatrice and I am an enterprise solutions representative at Coursera. I am following up on a contact you made to us through the form on Coursera website. I would like to speak with you to better understand the learning needs of {!Account.Name} and if we can potentially collaborate. 

Would you be free for a quick call early next week? Please, let me know your availability, so we can set up a call at your earliest convenience.

Thank you in advance for your attention and looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Heliatrice
